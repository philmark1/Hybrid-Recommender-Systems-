# Hybrid-Recommender-Systems-
Data Science Project on Hybrid Recommender System - done at the Institute of Institute for Data, Process and Knowledge Management for course 4 of the major "Data Science". 

In this project I was tasked to compare the accuracy of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to a new hybrid Recommender system, which will incorporate features of both item-based collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithm.

Please find attached a Jupyter notebook, with further comments on the code as well as a the (commented) Python code. I have also attached the two datasets (both .csv files), that I used in the project, which are originally from a kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
